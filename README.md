Clear instructions on how to run your program from the command line:

In Terminal: There is one expected argument that the human player needs to imput which is their player name. There is also one optional argument which is the computer name. Example the user would type in the terminal on their mac is: python3 go_fish.py Lindsay. From there the user is asked if they want to play the game, which they can either answer "yes" or "no". If the human player/user answers "yes" then the game begins. Throughout the game the user will be prompted to type in a rank [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,jack,queen,king,ace] when it is their turn. The game goes on until there is winner or tie.

Or the second possibility is that the computer player does not have the requested rank so you must "go fish", which means a random card will be given to you from the deck. Next, will be the computer player's turn. The computer will follow the same instructions as the human player just did. The goal of the game is to request ranks to create
